### This repo is a playground 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with examples of the use of Next.js, Typescript, GraphQl, etc â€¦

As a GraphQl API, I'm using here the [SpaceX open API](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/SpaceX-pxxbxen/explorer?variant=current)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) with your browser to see the result.
